YOLACT++
Better Real-time Instance Segmentation
Daniel Bolya∗, Chong Zhou∗, Fanyi Xiao, and Yong Jae Lee
Abstract—We present a simple, fully-convolutional model for real-time (> 30 fps) instance segmentation that achieves competitive
results on MS COCO evaluated on a single Titan Xp, which is signiﬁcantly faster than any previous state-of-the-art approach.
Moreover, we obtain this result after training on only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel
subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefﬁcients. Then we produce instance masks
by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefﬁcients. We ﬁnd that because this process doesn’t depend on repooling, this
approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of
our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional.
We also propose Fast NMS, a drop-in 12 ms faster replacement for standard NMS that only has a marginal performance penalty.
Finally, by incorporating deformable convolutions into the backbone network, optimizing the prediction head with better anchor scales
and aspect ratios, and adding a novel fast mask re-scoring branch, our YOLACT++ model can achieve 34.1 mAP on MS COCO at 33.5
fps, which is fairly close to the state-of-the-art approaches while still running at real-time.

INTRODUCTION
“Boxes are stupid anyway though, I’m probably a true believer
in masks except I can’t get YOLO to learn them.”

HAT would it take to create a real-time instance seg-
mentation algorithm? Over the past few years, the vision
community has made great strides in instance segmentation, in
part by drawing on powerful parallels from the well-established
domain of object detection. State-of-the-art approaches to instance
segmentation like Mask R-CNN [2] and FCIS [3] directly build
off of advances in object detection like Faster R-CNN [4] and R-
FCN [5]. Yet, these methods focus primarily on performance over
speed, leaving the scene devoid of instance segmentation parallels
to real-time object detectors like SSD [6] and YOLO [1], [7]. In
this work, our goal is to ﬁll that gap with a fast, one-stage instance
segmentation model in the same way that SSD and YOLO ﬁll that
gap for object detection.
However, instance segmentation is hard—much harder than
object detection. One-stage object detectors like SSD and YOLO
are able to speed up existing two-stage detectors like Faster R-
CNN by simply removing the second stage and making up for the
lost performance in other ways (e.g., strong data augmentation,
anchor clustering, etc.). The same approach is not easily ex-
tendable, however, to instance segmentation. State-of-the-art two-
stage instance segmentation methods depend heavily on feature
localization to produce masks. That is, these methods “re-pool”
features in some bounding box region (e.g., via RoI-pool/align),
and then feed these now localized features to their mask predictor.
This approach is inherently sequential and is therefore difﬁcult to
accelerate. One-stage methods that perform these steps in parallel

like FCIS do exist (e.g., [3], [8], [9]), but they require signiﬁcant
amounts of post-processing after localization, and thus are still far
from real-time.
To address these issues, we propose YOLACT1, a real-time
instance segmentation framework that forgoes an explicit local-
ization step. Instead, YOLACT breaks up instance segmentation
into two parallel tasks: (1) generating a dictionary of non-local
prototype masks over the entire image, and (2) predicting a set
of linear combination coefﬁcients per instance. Then producing a
full-image instance segmentation from these two components is
